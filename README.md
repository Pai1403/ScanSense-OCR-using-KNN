**OCR with KNN and OpenCV**
This project is an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system built using Python, OpenCV, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). 
It leverages the Digits dataset to train a model capable of recognizing handwritten numbers.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Features
1. Uses OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction.
2. Implements KNN for character classification.
3. Trained on the Digits dataset to recognize handwritten numbers.
4. Simple and efficient approach to OCR without deep learning.
   
Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
  
Usage

1. Load and preprocess the Digits dataset.
2. Train the KNN model.
3. Input an image containing handwritten digits.
4. Recognize and classify the digits.
5. Future Improvements
6. Improve accuracy with additional feature extraction.
7. Extend support to alphabets and custom datasets.
8. Integrate with real-world image processing applications.

Future updates
1. Inclue natural language
